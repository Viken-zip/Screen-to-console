# Screen to console

NOTE: this dose only work on Windows sorry Linux chads

a small C program that takes a "screenshot" saves in memory and displays it in terminal and repeats.
it might might slow if you have font size in console really small.

problems with diffrent monitors sizes will be fixed soon! (works best in 1440p).
memory leak and other problems are still there in this version...
